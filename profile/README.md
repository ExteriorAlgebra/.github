## Welcome to Exterior Algebra

Exterior algebra is an algebraic structure in mathematics where lower-dimensional forms are combined to produce new forms that represent higher-dimensional space. This idea inspires the philosophy behind our work: each person brings in parts of their world — pieces, taste, memories, and stories. Together, these span a space that feels personal, warm, and truly their own. Our slogan, “Span Your Space on the Internet,” reflects this metaphor. While “span” has a specific meaning in linear algebra that doesn’t technically apply here, we embrace this slight mathematical liberty because it captures the essence of what we’re building: from simple forms, a meaningful and dimensional space emerges.
